# RFM-Analysis

RFM Analysis for Customer Insights and Behavioral Segmentation
In this project, I implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This technique is widely used in marketing and business intelligence to identify high-value customers, improve customer retention, and create personalized marketing strategies.

# Key Highlights:

Recency: Measures how recently a customer made a purchase.
Frequency: Measures how often the customer makes purchases.
Monetary: Measures how much money the customer has spent.
Project Features:

Data Integration: Processed and cleaned customer transaction data for meaningful insights.
RFM Score Calculation: Derived RFM scores for each customer by categorizing them into quintiles.
Customer Segmentation: Used RFM scores to classify customers into meaningful segments, such as:
Champions
Loyal Customers
Potential Loyalists
At Risk
Hibernating
Power BI Visualization: Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize customer segments and provide actionable insights.
Business Impact: This analysis helps businesses to:

Identify their most valuable customers.
Personalize marketing strategies based on customer behavior.
Allocate resources more effectively to retain high-value customers.
Detect customers at risk of churn and take proactive steps to re-engage them.
Tools and Technologies:

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
Python (Pandas, NumPy): For data preprocessing and calculation of RFM scores.
MySQL: For storing and querying customer transaction data.
By using RFM analysis, businesses can make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability.

This description covers the projectâ€™s goals, methods, and outcomes, while emphasizing the value of the analysis for business use cases.
